# Jouet-24-rudder
These are all the files one need to craft a rudder as I did for my JouÃ«t 24.//

The files are organised like this :

-Design report is as its name suggests the design report of the rudder. One can learn every step of the design and of the building of the part,

-Safran_assembly is a 3D modelisation of the whole part. One can understand how parts are assembly to each other,

-ame_bois is the catpart modelising the wooden structure which lays inside the rudder,

-ame-sup is the catpart modelising the extra thickness part,

-safran Escapade 1#2 and 2#2 are the two parts modelising the polystyrene profiles that must be shaped with a milling machine. Based on it, one can generate a GCODE and send it to the milling machine.

Enjoy !
